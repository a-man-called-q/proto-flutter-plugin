## 0.4.0

#### Features

- Added a native Moon Flutter toolchain with Proto-backed Flutter and Dart executables.
- Added Pub workspace discovery, project aliases, local dependency graph inference, and dependency installation.
- Added inferred `analyze`, `test`, and interactive Flutter app `run` tasks.

#### Improvements

- Converted the repository to a two-artifact Cargo workspace.
- Migrated the Flutter monorepo example to native Moon toolchain integration.
- Added separate release tags and checksums for the Proto and Moon WASM artifacts.

## 0.3.2

#### Fixes

- Prevented the pre-run hook from trapping when Flutter is invoked without arguments.
- Resolved downloads from Flutter's official archive metadata instead of reconstructing URLs.
- Fixed Apple Silicon beta availability by using architecture metadata as the source of truth.

#### Improvements

- Added deterministic resolver tests, Moonrepo development tasks, and pull request CI.
- Added documented Moonrepo task integration for Flutter consumers.
- Added a CI-verified Flutter monorepo example using Pub workspaces and Moon.

## 0.3.1

#### Fixes

- Point `dart` executable directly at `flutter/bin/cache/dart-sdk/bin/dart` instead of the Flutter wrapper script. The wrapper triggers `flutter_tools` snapshot rebuilds, `pub upgrade`, and a git revision check on every invocation, making standalone Dart commands (e.g. `dart compile`) slow or fragile in proto-managed environments. ([#4](https://github.com/KonstantinKai/proto-flutter-plugin/pull/4))

## 0.3.0

## 0.2.2

#### Fixes

- Fixed typos in error messages ("Plase" → "Please", "manualy" → "manually")

#### Improvements

- Cached distribution metadata to avoid redundant network requests during install
- Added comments for version threshold constants
- Enhanced README with usage examples, version detection, supported platforms table, and proto version requirement
- Added GitHub Actions release workflow
- Removed redundant `build-wasm.sh` script

## 0.2.1

#### Fixes

## 0.2.0

#### Features

- Filter available versions by platform and architecture compatibility
- Support legacy versions with `v` prefix (< 1.17.0) on compatible platforms
- Show descriptive error when installing an unsupported version for the current OS/arch

#### Tests

- Added platform validation tests (macOS ARM64, Linux non-x64, Windows non-x64, unknown OS)
- Added version range and alias resolution tests
- Added download URL generation tests for all supported platforms
